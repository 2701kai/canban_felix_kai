# AI Development Context for Project "Canban"

This project uses a modern, bleeding-edge stack. Please prioritize the following versions and patterns:

- **Tailwind CSS v4.1:**

  - We use `@plugin` syntax in the main CSS file for plugins like typography.
  - The `tailwind.config.js` uses ESM (`import`/`export`).
  - [Link to official Tailwind v4 docs]

- **Vite 5.x:**

  - All configurations should follow the latest Vite standards.

- **React 19:**

  - Use React 19 features where appropriate.

- **General Instructions:**
  - Before suggesting installing a new package, check `package.json` first.
  - Always prefer the official documentation for the versions listed above.

```bash
# create a prompt with
"Here is my package.json. Please analyze it and provide me with a summary of the key technologies and links to their most relevant documentation pages. This will be our source of truth for this session."
```

```txt
Great advice! && created .ai-context. && check my package.json. Please analyze it and provide me with a summary of the key technologies and links to their most relevant documentation pages. This will be our source of truth for this session. factor also in context7. also current react-router documentation, json server and so on. execute an analysis of entire project to gain a profound impression, enabling you the best possible code efficiently as the senior developer, that you are.
if you did all that, update .ai-context respectively. also exclude any files .ai related from upload to github.
```
