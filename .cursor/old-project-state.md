# CANBAN PROJECT STATE - BEFORE WEBHOOK IMPLEMENTATION

## CURRENT SESSION STATUS
- API Server: RUNNING on port 3001
- Dev Server: RUNNING on port 5173
- User: 2701kai (user_2yYUsJ4ROurxNpKNLhUhjSemgkx)
- Last DB Sync: 2025-06-21T12:11:39.940Z
- Session Date: 2025-06-21

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
- Database modifications require MANDATORY backup first (ONLY for db/db.json edits)
- NOT for frontend code, documentation, or other files
- User prefers manual DB editing over automated changes
- Clerk integration is configured but needs proper user sync testing
- User display names showing incorrect data (core issue to solve)
- Context loss is a MAJOR issue causing significant user frustration

## ESTABLISHED FACTS
- Clerk credentials configured in .env
- useClerkSync hook is re-enabled with safeguards
- UserSyncService integration is ready
- Member display showing "kaiweinem" instead of proper usernames
- Database has duplicate user entries that need resolution

## IMMEDIATE TASK
- Test and verify Clerk user sync is working properly
- Resolve user name display issues in member list
- Ensure proper Clerk data flows to local database

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
- Never run npm commands without checking if servers already running
- Always reference this file before major actions
- Treat established facts as immutable
- Build incrementally on previous work
- Create timestamped backups before ANY database changes

## USER EXPERTISE LEVEL
- Junior developer requiring senior guidance
- Expects professional-level assistance
- Zero tolerance for context loss or basic failures

## PERFORMANCE METRICS

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Database user ID mismatches
- User display name priority chain not working correctly

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
