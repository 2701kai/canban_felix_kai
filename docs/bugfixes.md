# Recent Bugfixes & Stability Improvements

![Heute mal frei?](../public/Heute-mal-frei.webp)

This document outlines key bugfixes and stability improvements recently applied to the Canban application during our comprehensive MeisterTask clone transformation, as detailed in our [MeisterTask Clone PRD](./meistertask-clone-prd.md).

## ðŸŽ¯ MeisterTask Implementation Context

Our recent bugfixes are part of the larger MeisterTask clone implementation effort, ensuring that new features integrate seamlessly with existing functionality while maintaining the high-quality user experience outlined in our PRD.

## 1. Responsive Layout Overflow Fix

- **Problem:** On mobile devices, certain pages exhibited horizontal overflow, causing a disruptive user experience. On desktops, this could cause "letterboxing".
- **Root Cause:** The `w-screen` utility class on some full-width components was slightly wider than the visible viewport due to scrollbars.
- **Solution:** Implemented a targeted CSS fix by programmatically adding a class to the `<body>` on specific pages (`index.page.tsx`). This new class, `.homepage-body-active`, applies `overflow-x: hidden` only where needed, preventing side-effects on other parts of the application, like the dashboard, where horizontal scrolling is a feature.

## 2. Video Background Loop Smoothing

- **Problem:** The homepage's background video had a noticeable "jump" or "cut" when it looped.
- **Solution:** A custom CSS crossfade animation (`smooth-loop`) has been added. This animation fades the video in and out at the start and end of its loop, creating a seamless and more professional-looking playback experience. After loads of fun, we opted for a more conservative option with a pixel animation.

## 3. Navbar Visibility on Scroll

- **Problem:** The auto-hiding navbar on the homepage was not reappearing reliably under all conditions.
- **Solution:** The logic in `navbar.org.tsx` has been refined. The navbar now correctly and smoothly reappears when the user scrolls up or when the mouse cursor enters the top portion of the viewport, ensuring it is both immersive and accessible.

## 4. Database Cleanup for File Previews

- **Problem:** The smart file preview system could, in some edge cases, leave temporary preview data in the database.
- **Solution:** The cleanup mechanism in `src/lib/preview-cache.ts` has been hardened. The system now more reliably removes the `base64` data from the `attachment.data` field after a preview is closed, ensuring zero long-term database bloat.

## 5. Major Manual Database & Auth Cleanup

- **The Challenge:** After initial setup and testing, the user database (`db/db.json`) contained redundant, test, and incorrectly configured user accounts created both manually and through Clerk authentication integration. Additionally, sensitive credentials in the `.env` file needed to be updated.

- **The Fix & The Feeling:** This was a significant manual effort. **2701kai** personally went through the `db.json` file, line by line, to remove the stale user entries, purged incorrect records from Clerk, and updated the `.env` file.
- For him, this was less of **a small step for a dev,** and more of **a giant leap for mankind** - a true intellectual milestone. He was, to put it mildly, slightly proud.

  > **Fictional Senior Dev (off-comment):**<br> _"Yaay, great again... though heÂ´s not quite sure if he fixed the 8 billion issues he was the root cause for in the first place. But we'll take the win."_
  >
  > Whatever.

- **Outcome:** The user database is now clean, accurate, and in sync with the authentication provider. This strenuous but necessary task ensures data integrity and security moving forward.

## 6. Tag System Database Cleanup & Architecture Fix (January 2025)

- **Problem:** Critical database integrity issues preventing tag system functionality:

  - Duplicate task entries (mt04, mt05) with conflicting data structures
  - Missing DevOps Pipeline task tags (`DevOps`, `CI/CD`, `Automation`, `Infrastructure`)
  - Inconsistent JSON formatting causing parsing errors
  - `useTasks` hook was column-specific, couldn't fetch board-level tasks for filtering

- **Root Cause:** Database had accumulated duplicate entries during development, with some tasks existing in multiple formats. The original API architecture was designed for column-level task management, not board-wide operations.

- **Solution:** Comprehensive database and API architecture overhaul:

  - **Database Cleanup:** Manually removed all duplicate task entries, standardized JSON structure
  - **New API Method:** Created `tasksApi.getBoardTasks()` for board-level task fetching
  - **New React Hook:** Implemented `useBoardTasks()` for board-wide task state management
  - **Import Fixes:** Added missing TagGroup imports causing ReferenceError in TaskCard component
  - **Data Validation:** Ensured all 6 MeisterTask sample tasks have proper tag arrays

- **Impact:**

  - âœ… All 18 unique tags now display correctly in filtering system
  - âœ… DevOps Pipeline task with missing tags (`DevOps`, `CI/CD`, `Automation`, `Infrastructure`) restored
  - âœ… Tag filtering system fully functional with live task counts
  - âœ… No more runtime errors or database parsing issues
  - âœ… Board-level operations now work seamlessly

- **Technical Details:**
  ```typescript
  // New API method for board-level task management
  getBoardTasks: async (boardId: string): Promise<Task[]> => {
    const columns = await apiClient.get(`/columns?boardId=${boardId}`);
    const allTasks = await Promise.all(
      columns.map((col) => apiClient.get(`/tasks?columnId=${col.id}`))
    );
    return allTasks.flat();
  };
  ```

These fixes enhance the overall stability, performance, and polish of the Canban application.
