## 🔧 What It Is

A zero-fluff launchpad for founders. You bring the spark, we build your MVP — fast, functional, ready for user feedback. Then we stay. For the scaling, the systematizing, the scary parts.

---

## 🌀 Phase 1 — Build

**You:**

- Have an idea.
- Want a real product, not a pitch deck.
- Need something live, yesterday.

**We:**

- Turn your concept into an MVP using modern tools: React 19, Vite, TailwindCSS 4.1, Clerk, shadcn.
- Ship a clean, scalable codebase you *own*.
- Work fast. Work smart. No fluff.

---

## 📈 Phase 2 — Boost

**Your MVP works. People care. Now what?**

**You:**

- Face demand, traction, pressure.
- Need ops, architecture, maybe co-founders or capital.
- Can’t burn out.

**We:**

- Help you scale — infra, team, workflows.
- Bring in heavyweights: startup veterans like Carsten & Ben (yes, *those* ones).
- Support you with coaching, CTO-level consulting, or full-stack build power.

## 🧘‍♂️ Phase 3 — Breathe

**You:**

- Are building a company.
- Need to stay sane, sharp, and focused.
- Want a partner, not a vendor.

**We:**

- Stay flexible.
- Plug in where needed.
- Help you stay you — cool, clear, in control.

**Just Software. No Fuzz.**
